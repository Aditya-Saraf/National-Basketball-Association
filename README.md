# National-Basketball-Association
Data Analysis on NBA dataset from Kaggle as part of Project in course CSC522 at NCSU.

## Introduction
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America that is composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is the premier men’s professional basketball league in the world[6]. This project analyzes the NBA dataset to discover patterns between various aspects of the player and their impact on the game. For an instance— career span of players on the basis of the positions they play or their biological aspects.

### The Challenge: Data
This project has been started with my no previous knowledge in the game of Basketball thus most of the Data mining techniques used, yielded no pattern.

### Data
Dataset has been taken from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/10701/project/databasebasketball2.0.zip


## Basic Pipeline
- Data Visualizaton: K means clustering, silhouette method, elbow method and distortion.
- Data preprocessing: Estimation of null values using mean, mediuns and linear
regressions. 
- Data mining models: KNN, Random Forests, Logistic Regression.
